# Dark Mysteries

[GitHub](https://github.com/FriendlyOneDev/dark-mysteries)

This is a project we built during a 3 day hackathon from July 25th to 28th, 2025.

It was my first collaborative project - we were a team of three: one frontender and two backenders (I was one of the backend devs). We actually created a working website and deployed it on [Render](https://dark-mysteries.onrender.com/).  

_Note: the site may take a while to load due to Render's free tier, and it may be out of tokens depending on when you're reading this ðŸ˜…._

The idea behind the site is inspired by old mystery games, where players ask yes/no questions to uncover the hidden story. The twist? You get to play with an LLM acting as the narrator.

We split the work into three parts:

- **My role:** I handled WebSocket and LLM integration, and also pitched in on server-side tasks whenever I had spare time.  
- [My backend friend](https://github.com/NataMontari): Built the server side using FastAPI.  
- [My frontend friend](https://github.com/BUTURUM): Took care of the frontend using Node and Vite. He also helped us untangle our git structure and maintain it's health, as he was the most experienced with GitHub.

Also, you see those "<<<<<<< Updated upstream ======= >>>>>>> Stashed changes" in the upper left corner? That was a last minute push before the hackathon deadline, just to add "how to play functionality". In the spirit of hackathon we decided to not touch the project after the deadline.
