Now this is more interesting. This one delves deeper in OOP, and how objects can interact with each other. Also, gets you comfortable with using external libraries(including reading docs) and using modular approach to separate your code in pieces. 

Under the hood, everything here are circles. Including player ship. This makes collision detection fairly easy, just compare the distance between centers of 2 circles and sum of their radii.
