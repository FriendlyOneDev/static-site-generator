# AI agent

This one interesting too(all of them are from this point onward :D). It's an AI powered coding assistant. It's given a list of functions to read\write\run files(restricted to a playground directory). Using feedback loop it iterates until the task at hand is done(or until 20 iterations, to prevent infinite loop).
