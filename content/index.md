# Me

Hello, and welcome to my page! I'm Danylo, an aspiring Python developer from Ukraine.

## Me&Code

I began delving into code at the end of 2021 by studying a paid course called "Python Developer" at the online school "Skillfactory".  
However, that studying was pretty brief, because shortly after, the war started, and it became hard to concentrate on learning.  
On top of that, Skillfactory is a Russian course, so I ended up abandoning it. I just didn't want to interact with that community at the time.

Two years later, in 2024, I got a job at PwC as a Data Consolidator.  
Not even half a year in, I moved into something more interesting to me: using Alteryx to build data pipelines.  
Working with Alteryx reignited my spark for programming, so I began studying backend development at boot.dev.

I started it around two months ago and [haven’t missed a day of learning since](https://www.boot.dev/u/friendlyone).  
In just these two months, I’ve already learned far more than during my time at Skillfactory and completed half a dozen projects.  
That number will only keep growing, as I'm genuinely excited to keep moving forward in this direction and making stuff **that matters**.

## Projects

_Below is a list of projects in ascending order of complexity that I’ve built since joining the Boot.dev course. One of them was created during a 3-day hackathon I participated in. Click any project to see a short summary._

- [Assisted Project: Bookbot](/projects/bookbot)
- [Assisted Project: Asteroids](/projects/asteroids)
- [Assisted Project: AI-Agent](/projects/ai-agent)
- [Assisted Project: Static Site Generator](/projects/static-site-generator) - _This is actually what generated the site you're reading!_
- [Personal Project: Downloader Bot](/projects/downloader-bot)
- [Group Project: Dark Mysteries](/projects/dark-mysteries) - _Hackathon project_
- More to come...

**Note:** _"Assisted Project"_ means the project idea and general direction, and code that wasn't the purpose of the project(like learning vector logic for pygame) were provided by Boot.dev, but not the actual solution that I had to write myself.
 
 _Also, I didn't bother with adding readme's for most of those assisted projects_
