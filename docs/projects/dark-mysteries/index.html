    <article><div><h1>Dark Mysteries</h1><p>This is a project we built during a 3 day hackathon from July 25th to 28th, 2025.</p><p>It was my first collaborative project - we were a team of three: one frontender and two backenders (I was one of the backend devs). We actually created a working website and deployed it on <a href="https://dark-mysteries.onrender.com/">Render</a>.</p><p><i>Note: the site may take a while to load due to Render's free tier, and it may be out of tokens depending on when you're reading this ðŸ˜….</i></p><p>The idea behind the site is inspired by old mystery games, where players ask yes/no questions to uncover the hidden story. The twist? You get to play with an LLM acting as the narrator.</p><p>We split the work into three parts:</p><ul><li><b>My role:</b> I handled WebSocket and LLM integration, and also pitched in on server-side tasks whenever I had spare time.  </li><li><a href="https://github.com/NataMontari">My backend friend</a>: Built the server side using FastAPI.  </li><li><a href="https://github.com/BUTURUM">My frontend friend</a>: Took care of the frontend using Node and Vite. He also helped us untangle our git structure and maintain it's health, as he was the most experienced with GitHub.</li></ul><p><img src="/images/homepage.png" alt="homepage"></img>

That was a last minute push before the hackathon deadline, just to add "how to play functionality". In the spirit of hackathon we decided to not touch the project after the deadline.</p></div></article>
